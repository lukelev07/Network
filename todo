1. document methods
3. test methods
4. list of valid moves
5. edges in graph
6. check for win
7. strategy
8. find worst chip on the board



start param at 6 
if param == 0 , return true: 
for each chip in spot //
    check for connections to that chip (set to visited first) 
        for each connection
            call recursively (param - 1) if not checked already 


TO DO LUKE REMINDER !

finish for loop in ab search
think of ways to improve blocking strat 
find worst chip on board for step moves (no connection, etc)

---> when uncommented use this in ab-pruning: for (Move m : possibleMoves) {}
---> implement boolean reset on hasNetwork()
